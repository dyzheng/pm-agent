# Project Charter: ABACUS 稀土 DFT+U 计算能力完善（工程项目）

**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Project ID:** f-electron-scf

## Goals

Solve f_in_valence rare-earth element norm-conserving pseudopotential SCF convergence problems in ABACUS: pseudopotential testing/generation, orbital optimization, DFT+U convergence, high ecutwfc performance, AI-guided initial charge guess, damped charge constraint, and cross-validation with VASP/all-electron codes across alloys, magnetic compounds, surface catalysis, and molecular catalysis scenarios.

## Success Criteria

[TODO: define quantitative success criteria, e.g.:]
- [ ] Criterion 1: [metric] [target value]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [metric] [target value]
- [ ] Criterion 3: [metric] [target value]

## Scope

**In scope:**
